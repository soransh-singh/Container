    "Python is an object-oriented language. It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach. In Python, we can easily create and use classes and objects.An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-word entities. It is a widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)."

    "Python—it searches a tree of linked objects, looking for the first appearance of attribute that it can find. When classes are involved, the preceding Python expression effectively translates to the following in natural language:Find the first occurrence of attribute by looking in object, then in all classes above it, from bottom to top and left to right.In other words, attribute fetches are simply tree searches. The term inheritance is applied because objects lower in a tree inherit attributes attached to objects higher in that tree. As the search proceeds from the bottom up, in a sense, the objects linked into a tree are the union of all the attributes defined in all their tree parents, all the way up the tree."
